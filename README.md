# Web-Design-Challenge
For this assignment, I created a website based on the observations and visualizations from my Python-API assignment. Focused on 573 cities across the world, my website has individual pages for each weather element. There is also a page to provide a comparison of all the plots, along with another page to present the data used to build them. Additionally, the website is size responsive so that it can be viewed on any device easily.

The website can be accessed at https://tebohl.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/
